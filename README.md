To execute Terraform from Jenkins while authenticating with AWS, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Terraform plugin on Jenkins: You need to install the Terraform plugin on Jenkins, which allows Jenkins to interact with Terraform. You can do this by going to "Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugin" and searching for "Terraform". Then, you can install the plugin.

2. Configure the global tool for Terraform: You need to configure the global tool for Terraform in Jenkins. You can do this by going to "Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration" and adding the path where Terraform is installed.

3. Create a Jenkins pipeline: You need to create a Jenkins pipeline that includes the following steps:

- Checkout the Terraform code from the Git repository.
- Authenticate with AWS using AWS credentials.
- Initialize the Terraform working directory.
- Plan and apply the Terraform configurations.

Here is a Jenkins pipeline code that executes Terraform while authenticating with AWS:

This pipeline is using the `AmazonWebServicesCredentialsBinding` to authenticate with AWS using the AWS access key ID and secret access key. It is also specifying the AWS region as `us-west-2`. Finally, It is checking out the Terraform code from a Git repository, initializing the Terraform working directory, planning the Terraform configurations, and applying the Terraform configurations.
